## ArrayMethodsTest.java
JUnit tests ArrayMethods.java methods

## ReadFile.java

Prints requested info for YUMA.txt

## ClimateQueries.java
ClimateQueries methods (isEqualTo,isGreaterThan, LogicalNot, LogicalAnd, datesBetween, count,findFirst, find)
Analyzes Dhaka.txt  file and stores requested information (annual temp averages, days over30C, first day to exceed first yr annual avg, etc) in arrays
Prints out analyses and the results of hte first half vs second half comparison

## Dhaka.txt
File to be analyzed by ClimateQueries

## ClimateQueriesTest.java
JUnit tests ClimateQueries.java methods

# Reflection: 
Mucho trabajo, poco tiempo
The JUnit testing was annoying and reptitive, but it was good practice to learn how to check for certain thrown exceptions.
It was really enjoyable to analyze Yuma.txt and Dhaka.txt in order to reach conclusions-it was like a puzzle to put together the different methods to find the needed information.
