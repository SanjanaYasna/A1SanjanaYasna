# Practice Assignment
Here is a practice assignment for getting used to GitHub Classroom.
Your assignment is to add one method and a test of that method to the repository.

GitHub will automatically compile any .java files it finds in this directory: [app/src/main/java/practice](https://github.com/SmithCSC210/practice-assignment/blob/main/app/src/main/java/practice)
You should navigate to that directory and add your method to [`App.java`](https://github.com/SmithCSC210/practice-assignment/blob/main/app/src/main/java/practice/App.java)

It will run tests located in this directory: [app/src/test/java/test](https://github.com/SmithCSC210/practice-assignment/tree/main/app/src/test/java/practice)
You can add your test to [`AppTest.java`](https://github.com/SmithCSC210/practice-assignment/tree/main/app/src/test/java/practice/AppTest.java)

If you move these files, the compilation is likely to stop working!

Once you have made a commit, you can see how your code did on the tests using the `Actions` tab at the top of your repository.
