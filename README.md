# Overview of what each major file does:
## ArrayMethods.java
Contains essentail array methods (wholeSum, sum, mean, min, max, isGreaterThan, lowest, and highest) <br>

## ArrayMethodsTest.java
JUnit tests ArrayMethods.java methods

## ReadFile.java
Uses methods from ClimateQueries and ArrayMethods classes in order to analyze YUMA.txt file <br>
Prints requested info for YUMA.txt

## ClimateQueries.java
ClimateQueries methods (isEqualTo,isGreaterThan, LogicalNot, LogicalAnd, datesBetween, count,findFirst, find) <br>
Analyzes Dhaka.txt  file and stores requested information (annual temp averages, days over30C, first day to exceed first yr annual avg, etc) in arrays <br>
Prints out analyses and the results of hte first half vs second half comparison

## Dhaka.txt
File to be analyzed by ClimateQueries

## ClimateQueriesTest.java
JUnit tests ClimateQueries.java methods

# Reflection: 
Mucho trabajo, poco tiempo
The JUnit testing was annoying and reptitive, but it was good practice to learn how to check for certain thrown exceptions. I want to learn more JUnit testing functions so that I get to the point where I can see the true utiliy of JUnit testing and test what I can't easily test from a main method.<br>
It was really enjoyable to analyze Yuma.txt and Dhaka.txt in order to reach the requested conclusions-it was like a puzzle to put together the different methods to find the needed information. Next assignment, I would like to try the graphical analyses parts. I had to hold off doing the SVG part of this assignment, but it would've been cool if I could allocate such time. <br>
